Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib


#Linear Regression
Linear Regression
Select Dataset of your choice and respond to following questions.
- Why you want to apply regression on selected dataset? Discuss full
story behind dataset.
- How many total observations in data?
- How many independent variables?
- Which is dependent variable?
- Which are most useful variable in estimation? Prove using
correlation.
- Quantify goodness of your model and discuss steps taken for
improvement (RMSE, SSE, R2Score).
