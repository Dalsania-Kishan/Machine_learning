# Machine_learning
different practicals

Introduction to Python Programming. How python used in machine
learning? Discuss python with Google Colab.


Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib


Linear Regression
Select Dataset of your choice and respond to following questions.
- Why you want to apply regression on selected dataset? Discuss full
story behind dataset.
- How many total observations in data?
- How many independent variables?
- Which is dependent variable?
- Which are most useful variable in estimation? Prove using
correlation.
- Quantify goodness of your model and discuss steps taken for
improvement (RMSE, SSE, R2Score).


Two Class Classification (Logistic Regression)
Select Dataset of your choice and respond to following questions.
- Why you want to apply classification on selected dataset? Discuss
full story behind dataset.
- How many total observations in data?
- How many independent variables?
- Which is dependent variable?
- Which are most useful variable in classification? Prove using
correlation.
- Quantify goodness of your model and discuss steps taken for
improvement (Accuracy, Confusion matrices, F-measure).


Multi Class Classification (KNN)
Select Dataset of your choice and respond to following questions.
- Why you want to apply classification on selected dataset? Discuss
full story behind dataset.
- How many total observations in data?
- How many independent variables?
- Which is dependent variable?
- Which are most useful variable in classification? Prove using
correlation.
- Quantify goodness of your model and discuss steps taken for
improvement.
- Can we use KNN for regression also? Why / Why not?
- Discuss drawbacks of algorithms such as KNN.

Comparative analysis of models using quantitative measures.
(F-measures, confusion Matrix, RMSE etc.).

Use Support Vector Machines/Na√Øve Bayes to train your model and
compare it with the other models. (use Sci-kit-learn library)



Perceptron algorithm for logic gates.


Implementing Neural Net with back propagation

Implement Convolutional neural network. Tune for real datasets. (use
Keras library)


Use K-Means Clustering algorithm based on some parameter.
